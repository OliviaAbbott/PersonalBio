  <p>
    Originally I was only a math major because I was strong in math in high school.
    Once I got to college I realized that I wanted to expand my interests.  I took a computer science
    class to see how I liked it and I found that I really enjoyed the subject.
    After that I decided I wanted to pursue a career in the computer science field.
    I have learned how to code in c++ and am currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
